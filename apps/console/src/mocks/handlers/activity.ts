// The overview's activity feed (#239): a static replay for the initial read,
// plus an SSE tail that stays idle. Mock mode has no live event source, so
// the stream sends the done sentinel and closes immediately — useActivityFeed
// treats that as a clean end and reconnects (matching prod's reconnect
// behaviour on a dropped connection), but since the seeded read already has
// every event, no visible gap results.
// Scenario switch (api-guidelines: mocks must produce the empty state too):
//   localStorage.setItem('aep:mock:activity', 'empty')
